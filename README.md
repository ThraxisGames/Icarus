# Icarus

> Earn Your Wings

Icarus is a bare bones, simple tabletop RPG.  It is best used as an introduction to tabletop games and for one-shot campaigns.

This companion app is meant for quick and easy character creation and management. We are currently building using PhoneGap and will most likely be using Backbone.js as our framework.

More to come.
